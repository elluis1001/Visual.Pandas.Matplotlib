# Pymaceuticals Analysis

This project analyzed the results of an animal study that tested the effectiveness of various drug regimens in treating squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer. The study involved 249 mice identified with SCC tumor growth, and they were treated through a variety of drug regimens over the course of 45 days. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals' drug of interest, Capomulin, versus the other treatment regimens.

## Instructions

The analysis was broken down into the following tasks:

1. Prepare the data
2. Generate summary statistics
3. Create bar charts and pie charts
4. Calculate quartiles, find outliers, and create a box plot
5. Create a line plot and a scatter plot
6. Calculate correlation and regression

## Requirements

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- NumPy
- SciPy

## Prepare the Data

- Merged the `mouse_metadata` and `study_results` DataFrames into a single DataFrame
- Displayed the number of unique mice IDs in the data
- Checked for any mouse ID with duplicate time points
- Displayed the data associated with that mouse ID
- Created a new DataFrame where the duplicate data was removed
- Displayed the updated number of unique mice IDs

## Generate Summary Statistics

- Created a DataFrame of summary statistics
- Included a row for each drug regimen
- Included columns for mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM of the tumor volume

## Create Bar Charts and Pie Charts

- Generated two identical bar charts showing the total number of rows (Mouse ID/Timepoints) for each drug regimen throughout the study
  - Created one chart using Pandas DataFrame.plot()
  - Created the other chart using Matplotlib's pyplot
- Generated two identical pie charts showing the distribution of female versus male mice in the study
  - Created one chart using Pandas DataFrame.plot()
  - Created the other chart using Matplotlib's pyplot

## Calculate Quartiles, Find Outliers, and Create a Box Plot

- Calculated the final tumor volume of each mouse across four promising treatment regimens: Capomulin, Ramicane, Infubinol, and Ceftamin
- Calculated the quartiles and IQR, and determined potential outliers across all four treatment regimens
- Generated a box plot that showed the distribution of the final tumor volume for all mice in each treatment group
- Highlighted any potential outliers in the plot

## Create a Line Plot and a Scatter Plot

- Selected a mouse that was treated with Capomulin and generated a line plot of tumor volume versus time point for that mouse
- Generated a scatter plot of mouse weight versus average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen

## Calculate Correlation and Regression

- Calculated the correlation coefficient and linear regression model between mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for the entire Capomulin treatment regimen
- Plotted the linear regression model on top of the previous scatter plot

## Observations and Insights

- Observation 1
- Observation 2
- Observation 3

## Submission

Reviewed all the figures and tables generated in this assignment. Wrote at least three observations or inferences that could be made from the data and included these observations at the top of the notebook.
